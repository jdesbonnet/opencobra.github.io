These constraints include compartmentalization, mass conservation, molecular crowding, and thermodynamic directionality.\tMore recently, transcriptome data have been used to reduce the size of the set of computed feasible states.\t Although COBRA methods may not provide a unique solution, they provide a reduced set of solutions that may be used to guide biological hypothesis development. Given its initial success, COBRA has attracted attention from many investigators and has developed rapidly in recent years based on contributions from a growing number of laboratories – COBRA methods have been used in hundreds of studies.     \r\n\r\nThe openCOBRA project has arisen to provide researchers with easy access to core COBRA methodologies, and to provide a repository for community contributed modules that build off of these core COBRA Features.  The openCOBRA Project was initiated with tools for MATLAB but has now grown to include Python-based modules for dealing with the complex relationships of the next generation of COBRA models.\r\n\r\nThe openCOBRA project is currently maintained by [Daniel R. Hyduke](http://danielhyduke.com) from Utah State University and [Ali Ebrahim](http://sbrg.ucsd.edu/Researchers/Ebrahim) and [Nathan Lewis](http://systemsbiology.ucsd.edu/Researchers/Lewis) from UCSD.\r\n\r\n#Cite Our Software\r\n### COBRA for Python\r\nEbrahim A, Lerman JA, Palsson BO, Hyduke DR. 2013  [COBRApy: COnstraints-Based Reconstruction and Analysis for Python](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/7/74/abstract).
